It is built using modern front-end technologies, including React, Redux Toolkit, TailwindCSS, and other libraries.

**Features YouTube Clone:**

The project is a replica of the YouTube platform, including its UI design and functionalities. YouTube Video List: The app displays a paginated list of YouTube videos fetched from the YouTube API. The list supports lazy loading to enhance performance. YouTube Video Preview: Clicking on a video in the list opens a preview window that displays the selected video. The preview window includes basic details of the video, such as its title, description, and view count. Search Suggestions: As the user types in the search bar, the app displays a dropdown list of suggested search queries. This feature enhances the user experience and makes it easier to find relevant videos. Optimized Search Using Caching and Debouncing: The app uses debouncing to optimize the search functionality. This means that instead of making an API call for every key press in the search bar, the app waits until the user has stopped typing before making the API call. Additionally, the app uses caching to fetch the results of previous searches faster. Optimized API Calls Using Debouncing: The app uses debouncing to optimize API calls throughout the app. For example, when a user scrolls through the video list, the app waits until the user has stopped scrolling before fetching more videos. This feature reduces the number of API calls made and improves performance. Comments on YouTube: The app includes a comments section that allows users to view and post comments on a video. The comments are fetched from the YouTube API and are displayed in a threaded view to enhance readability. Live Chat of YouTube - Get Data Live, Update UI Continuously Developed with API Polling: The app includes a live chat feature that allows users to view and send messages in real-time. The chat is implemented using API polling, which means that the app regularly makes API calls to fetch new messages and updates the UI accordingly.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
